This state will install some Datagrip linux-alternatives on GNU/Linux.

=== `datagrip.clean`

dependency on `datagrip.package.clean` via include list.

== Testing

Linux testing is done with `kitchen-salt`.

=== Requirements

* Ruby
* Docker

[source,bash]
----
$ gem install bundler
$ bundle install
$ bin/kitchen test [platform]
----

Where `[platform]` is the platform name defined in `kitchen.yml`, e.g.
`debian-9-2019-2-py3`.

=== `bin/kitchen converge`

Creates the docker instance and runs the `datagrip` main state, ready
for testing.

=== `bin/kitchen verify`

Runs the `inspec` tests on the actual instance.

=== `bin/kitchen destroy`

Removes the docker instance.

=== `bin/kitchen test`

Runs all of the stages above in one go: i.e. `destroy` + `converge` +
`verify` + `destroy`.

=== `bin/kitchen login`

Gives you SSH access to the instance for manual testing.
